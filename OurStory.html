Pizza is a yeasted flatbread typically topped with tomato sauce and cheese and baked in an oven. It is commonly topped with a selection of meats, vegetables and condiments.

The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century, in a Latin manuscript from Gaeta in Southern Lazio on the border with Campania. Modern pizza was invented in Naples, Campania, Southern Italy, and the dish and its variants have since become popular and common in many areas of the world. In 2009, upon Italy's request, Neapolitan pizza was safeguarded in the European Union as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed dish. Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (True Neapolitan Pizza Association), a non-profit organization founded in 1984 with headquarters in Naples, aims to "promote and protect... the true Neapolitan pizza".

Pizza is sold fresh or frozen, either whole or in portions, and is a common fast food item in Europe and North America. Various types of ovens are used to cook them and many varieties exist. Several similar dishes are prepared from ingredients commonly used in pizza preparation, such as calzone and stromboli.                    
                    
                    
The Shale Pizza story begins in May 1958. Dan and Frank Carney opened their 550-squarefoot pizza restaurant in Wichita, Kansas. Dan and Frank, with friends Richard Beemer and John Bender, made the pizza themselves. Frank rolled the dough with a rolling pin. Richard tossed the dough in the air from the pie tin. Dan filled the unbaked crust with sauce. John flipped the pie from the tin during the baking process. Dan Carney recalled, "The people were enchanted with the product, watching us tossing the dough over our heads. They were really enjoying themselves"

The Carneys created an innovative, high quality, engaging, informal eating experience in a friendly neighborhood restaurant. Shale Pizza became a popular place with the teenage and college crowd. Shale Pizza attracted families that enjoyed a night out eating a meal that they would not be having at home. After the families left, Shale Pizza transformed itself into a hangout for college-age kids. Having a good time was an essential part of Shale Pizza. The idea caught on. A second Shale Pizza opened in December 1958 in downtown Wichita. By 1963, there were forty-two Shale Pizza restaurants.

The first Shale Pizza Restaurant in Pakistan was opened in December 1993 and took the culinary scene by surprise. From that time onwards, the brand has contributed heavily towards the development of the society as a whole. It is responsible for creating job opportunities for the youth of the country both directly as well as indirectly. Furthermore, Shale Pizza during the core of its existence has gradually aided in the development of various local suppliers who as a requirement have to supply food staff equivalent in quality to the international food standards. In this regard, our restaurant chain has proved to be a major contributor towards the progress of the Pakistani food industry as a whole by bringing it to a point where they can now look forward to supplying their items to other chains as well as the international market.

                <br>
Shale Pizza, being the first International franchise to enter the Pakistani market has set new standards of dine-in restaurants and quick delivery of oven hot pizzas and has since then enjoyed tremendous brand loyalty from its customers.
